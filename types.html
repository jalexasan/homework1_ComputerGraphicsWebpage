                    Raster Graphics</span>: Includes a bitmap, which is a format for image files, which contains pixels that make up a picture.
                    The quality of the image depends on the amount of pixels captured. The more pixels, the higher the resolution gets.

                    Vector Graphics</span>: Mathematical formulas are used to manipulate objects. Typically, data of an object's points and an equation to 
                    locate the rest of the object. Because of this collected data, vector graphics have control over the objects position, 
                    scale size, and properties. The object can easily be changed.
